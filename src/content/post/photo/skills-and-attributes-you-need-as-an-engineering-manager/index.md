Being an engineering manager is no small feat. It requires a unique set of skills and attributes to effectively lead and support your team. In this post, we'll dive into some of the key qualities that make a successful manager.

## Overseeing Tasks

As a manager, your job is to keep an eye on your team’s tasks without doing all the work yourself. You’ll check in to make sure things are getting done and ensure the tasks assigned are realistic and doable. This is part of your bigger role in helping your team balance their work and personal lives—known as work/life balance.

## Building Work/Life Balance

Building a healthy work/life balance is key. It helps your team members lead satisfying lives outside of work. If that isn’t enough, there are business perks too. Well-rested teams are more resistant to burnout and happier at home, which means better creativity, lower turnover, and other positive outcomes. But honestly, supporting a good work/life balance because it’s the right thing to do should be reason enough.

## Supporting Professional Growth

As you manage your team, you’ll also help them grow professionally. One of the most rewarding parts of your job will be guiding your team members in their career development. Helping them set clear career goals and guiding them along their paths is crucial. Even if their long-term goals take them outside your team or company, you need to support them.

## Effective Communication

Another essential skill for managers is effective communication. It's not just about being clear and concise, but also about being a good listener. Understanding your team’s concerns and feedback helps build trust and fosters a collaborative environment. Being approachable and open to dialogue encourages your team to share their ideas and issues, leading to a more innovative and responsive team dynamic.

## Advocating for Your Team

All these responsibilities form your biggest role as a manager: advocating for your team. Balancing your obligations to the company with your duties to your team will be one of your biggest challenges. You’ll need to decide where to draw those ethical lines for yourself. But remember, the general duty to care for, protect, and advocate for your team is part of everyone’s management experience.

## Conclusion

Don’t worry if these responsibilities sound a bit abstract. We’ll dive deeper into the day-to-day tasks and duties you can expect as a manager. If these responsibilities sound exciting—or maybe both exciting and challenging—management might be a great fit for you.
