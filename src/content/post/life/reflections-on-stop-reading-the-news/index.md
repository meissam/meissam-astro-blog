I used to have an obsession with reading the news, but it only added a lot of stress to my life. That’s why I couldn't help but think about a book that has had a profound impact on me: *Stop Reading the News* by Rolf Dobelli. If you're still glued to the news, this book might just convince you that it’s not helping you at all.

There are so many things beyond our control, and we certainly can't change them by constantly reading the news. It's been about two months since I stopped reading, listening to, and watching any type of news. The positive effects on my life have been remarkable, to be honest. I highly recommend giving it a try.

Dobelli's book highlights how the digital age has turned the news from harmless entertainment into a weapon aimed directly at our mental health. One of the most striking parts of the preface states:

> Digitalization has turned the news from a harmless form of entertainment into a weapon of mass destruction, and it’s aimed straight at our mental health. We need to get out of the way.

> One thing is crucial to note here: restricting your consumption of the news doesn’t have to be a sacrifice. You’ll be richly rewarded – with more time and fresh eyes for what truly matters, what truly makes you happy.

This really hit home for me. Since cutting out the news, I’ve had more time to focus on the things that truly matter and bring joy into my life.

If you're feeling overwhelmed by the constant stream of news, I genuinely suggest picking up *Stop Reading the News*. It might just change your perspective and improve your mental well-being.
