I've always liked Erich Maria Remarque's *All Quiet on the Western Front*. It's one of those books that leaves you with a lingering sense of reflection and awe, much like the works of Richard Brautigan, albeit in a very different context. I first read the Persian translation, and now I'm sharing my thoughts with you in English.

There are some parts of the book that really stood out to me. Here are a few of my favorite quotes:

> Katczinsky is right when he says it would not be such a bad war if only they would let us sleep a little longer.

It's remarkable how the smallest comforts, like a bit of extra sleep, can become so significant in the midst of chaos. And speaking of chaos:

> It's strange that almost all the world's great men have been little men; it's a paradox.

This quote makes me think of the complexities of human nature and how often it's the unassuming figures who leave the biggest marks on history. But the harsh realities of war bring these reflections crashing down:

> Our first death shattered this belief. We had to recognize that our generation was more trustworthy than theirs. They excelled only in sophistry, in reasoning, and in petty far-sightedness. The first bombardment showed us our mistake, and under it the world as they had taught it to us broke in pieces.

And in the trenches, only the bare essentials mattered:

> All other considerations are pretty much dead. A good pair of boots is rare and precious.

The brutal training they underwent left a lasting impact, far more profound than years of formal education:

> In two weeks they gave us a course in military training that affected us more profoundly than ten years of schooling. We learned that polished buttons were worth more than four volumes of Schopenhauer. First we were confused, then we were furious, and finally we were indifferent. We realized that what mattered was not the mind but the shiny boots, not intelligence but drill, not freedom but regulations.

And sometimes, disillusionment with grand ideals sets in:

> Let him babble with his chewed words. Man dreams of a miracle and wakes up with empty hands.

Coming from a modest background, my family never made a fuss about showing emotions. Those who endure poverty and worry tend to be like that. Katczinsky's words about the nature of leadership and war resonated deeply:

> I don't quite know. He never had a war, didn't he? A good emperor needs at least one war to make him famous. Just look at your schoolbooks!
