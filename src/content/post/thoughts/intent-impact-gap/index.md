Ever walked away from a conversation thinking, _“I didn’t mean for it to land that way…”_? That’s the **intent-impact gap**—a subtle but powerful disconnect between what you meant and how it was received.

- **Intent**: Your desired outcome—what you hope your audience will _think_, _feel_, or _do_.
- **Impact**: The real outcome—what your audience actually _thinks_, _feels_, or _does_.

Even with the best intentions, communication can go off track. So how do you close that gap and ensure your message lands the way you need it to?

Before you present, pitch, or even send an email, take time to clarify your **communication purpose**. Ask yourself three powerful questions:

1. What do you want them to **think**?

This defines your audience’s cognitive takeaway. Do you want them to:

- Understand a new idea?
- Be persuaded by your proposal?
- Feel confident about next steps?

Clarifying this helps shape your message’s tone, structure, and clarity.

2. What do you want them to **feel**?

Feelings drive connection and motivation. Consider:

- Do you want them to feel inspired? Curious? Reassured?
- Should they perceive a personal strength—like creativity or resilience—based on how you deliver the message?

A well-timed anecdote or authentic tone can leave an emotional imprint that boosts your message’s stickiness.

3. What do you want them to **do**?

Action is where impact shows up. Be specific:

- **What** do you want them to do?
- **With whom** should they collaborate or communicate?
- **By when** should the action be completed?

Avoid vagueness—set clear expectations that empower follow-through.

You don’t need to be a master wordsmith to communicate effectively. You just need clarity, empathy, and intentionality. By grounding your message in a well-defined think–feel–do framework, you’re not just broadcasting information—you’re cultivating meaningful impact.
