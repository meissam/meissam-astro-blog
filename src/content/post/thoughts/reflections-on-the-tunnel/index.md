I've always been drawn to novels that burrow deep into the human psyche, and Ernesto Sabato's *El Túnel* is a prime example of this. I first read the Persian translation many years ago, and it left a lasting impression on me. It's one of those books that you feel compelled to revisit, especially with the mindset I've cultivated over the years.

*El Túnel* is a dark, psychological novel that tells the story of Juan Pablo Castel, a disturbed painter in Buenos Aires, and his obsessive fixation on a woman named María. This book isn't just a journey through Castel's troubled mind, but also a profound exploration of human isolation and despair.

One of the most striking quotes from the book is:

> The phrase ‘the good old days' does not mean that bad things happened less frequently in the past, only – fortunately – that people simply forget they happened.

This quote perfectly encapsulates the bittersweet nature of nostalgia and how we often romanticize the past, conveniently forgetting its hardships.

Sabato's writing is raw and unflinching, and *El Túnel* stands as a testament to his ability to delve into the darkest corners of the human experience. It’s a book that I highly recommend, especially if you're in the mood for something that challenges your perceptions and leaves you with more questions than answers.
