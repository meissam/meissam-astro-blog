## Mentoring as an Engineering Manager

Mentorship, whether formal or informal, is an invaluable process where one supports another through personal or professional development. In the workplace, mentoring can come from managers, peers, or any other team members. Typically, workplace mentorship includes regular calls or meetings to discuss topics chosen by the mentee, mirroring the conversations managers have with their direct reports.

### The Impact of Mentorship on Your Team

Mentorship can significantly enhance your team in various ways:

1. **Building Bonds of Trust:** Mentorship fosters trust, contributing to healthier working relationships.
2. **Skill Development:** Mentees gain new skills from the experience of their mentors.
3. **Soft Skills for Mentors:** Mentors develop valuable soft skills and people management abilities that benefit their daily interactions with peers.

Mentorship offers a preview of management-like conversations and support, allowing individuals to "try out" management without fully changing their rolesâ€”an opportunity rarely available outside of mentorship.

### Mutual Benefits

Both mentors and mentees benefit from the exchange by gaining new perspectives and approaches to their work. This dynamic enriches the workplace environment and promotes continuous learning.

### Setting Up Structured Mentoring Relationships

When establishing mentorship opportunities within your team, consider the following:

- **Pairing Dynamics:** Would pairing a senior member with a new team member fit your team's dynamic?
- **Recognition and Rewards:** How would you recognize and reward mentorship in performance reviews?

### Best Practices for Mentorship

1. **Equal Access:** Ensure all team members have equal access to mentorship and your time. Mentorship should be a valuable opportunity, not an unfair advantage.
2. **Communication:** Clearly communicate the limits of your mentorship to set proper expectations.

If team members are mentored by their manager, they will receive a specific managerial perspective. Encourage them to seek additional mentorship relationships, formal or informal, outside the workplace. External mentors offer different perspectives crucial for professional growth, even if it leads team members beyond your organization.
