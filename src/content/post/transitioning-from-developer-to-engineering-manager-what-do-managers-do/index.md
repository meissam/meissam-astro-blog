In this post, I'll explore the core responsibilities of an engineering manager and what it truly means to transition into this pivotal role.

## Understanding the Role

As an engineering manager, you'll translate abstract goals and visions from executive teams into actionable objectives for your team. You'll also advocate for your team by channeling their feedback and needs up to senior leadership. While every workplace differs—and your specific tasks may vary—there are common threads in the manager's role that I'll discuss.

## Key Responsibilities

**1. Team Oversight:** Regular team oversight is a key part of your job. This includes both team meetings and one-on-one sessions with individual members. These meetings serve multiple purposes, including helping your team maintain a healthy work-life balance.

**2. Stakeholder Management:** To support your team effectively, you'll collaborate with various stakeholders inside and outside the company. This includes meetings with your own managers, project leads, and clients. Managing these relationships often takes more time than new managers anticipate but is crucial for ensuring your team has the necessary tools, support, and information.

**3. Professional Development:** Setting clear, actionable goals for each team member and coaching them toward these objectives is another crucial aspect of your role. Regular, clear feedback helps your team understand their progress, and you'll have opportunities to reward their achievements through promotions or raises.

**4. Advocacy:** As a manager, you'll channel your team's feedback and needs up to senior leadership, advocating for them and ensuring their voices are heard.

**5. Transition Management:** Eventually, you may need to provide references when team members move on to new roles, whether within the company or elsewhere. As a good manager, you understand that most employees will eventually leave, but you can ensure they depart with positive memories and valuable professional growth from your guidance.

## Balancing Act

Being an engineering manager requires balancing various responsibilities and skills. It's about fostering a positive team culture, driving project success, and continuously learning and adapting to new challenges. The transition from developer to engineering manager is both rewarding and demanding, but with the right mindset and approach, it can lead to significant professional growth.
