		<p>Hi. I'm Meissam, a software engineer living in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

		<p>
			The story of this blog goes back to the years 2007-2008 in Iran, when I was a sophomore at
			university. Having a website back then was quite a hassle. If you wanted to build a website
			for yourself, you needed programming knowledge, which I didn't have at the time. I was a
			software engineering student, but I wasn't very knowledgeable about web design and programming
			yet. The cost of building and maintaining a website was also very high, and not everyone could
			afford it. However, blogging was very popular. You could find a lot of free blogging service
			providers. If you knew a bit of English, you could even use Google's Blogger or WordPress.
		</p>

		<p>
			You could always find bloggers who, after much effort and with dial-up internet or the early
			and expensive 128kbps ADSL, tried to produce original / pure content. But please don't confuse
			the old bloggers with today's Instagram and TikTok bloggers. If time permits, I'll try to
			write a separate post explaining the difference between the bloggers of those days and
			today's.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's go back to the story of my blog and where it started. My first eperience in creating a
			blog was the one I made for my father. A user account on PersianBlog and that was it.
		</p>

		<p>
			We started posting content on it. One of my interests was finding themes for the blog from
			among all the themes available. I'd go to Photoshop and create some headers and graphic
			assets. I had just learned that with a few lines of code, I could change the size and layout
			of fonts. Moreover, I learned that I could use some ready-made scripts to count the number of
			visits. Really funny üòã. Although, Due to censorship, PersianBlog deleted that blog without
			any prior notice and didn't even give us a chance to back up our posts. It was sad but good
			experience.
		</p>

		<p>
			I should admit that I wasn't into books until my university years. One of my university
			friends introduced me to "I'm OK, You're OK" by Thomas Harris, translated by Esmaeil Fasih.
			Back in those days, nothing could help me as much as that book. This book was the beginning of
			my interest in reading. With each book I read, my thirst for reading new books grew. This is
			when the idea of creating my own blog came to mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			I wanted to put summaries of everything I read in one place, hoping it might be useful to
			someone else in the world. So I didn't hesitate and created my first blog. With the bad
			experience I had with PersianBlog, this time I turned to MihanBlog, another blogging platform
			in Iran. A user account and that was it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Unfortunately, my blog faced the same fate as my father's blog. Fortunately, MihanBlog allowed
			me to back up the blog before it was deleted.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, years have passed since those days and I still have my blog. But now I'm a software
			engineer and have learned how to set up my blog in different ways. The code for this blog is
			all hosted on GitHub and is open-source. Whenever I add a post to my blog, it is automatically
			published on a free server, and you can read it. I'm no longer worried about unexpected
			deletions and am fairly confident (to some extent) that
			<a

				title="Arctic Code Vault"
			>
				Microsoft has backed up these writings deep in a mountain in the Arctic.
			</a>
			They said those backups are built and equipped to last for thousands of years. So, I can hope that
			the writings of this blog will be preserved for thousands of years. Maybe you'll come across them
			one day and enjoy them, making it a topic for a <a
